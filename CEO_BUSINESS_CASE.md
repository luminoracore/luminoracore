### **Real Code Example (How It Works):**

```python
# 1. Load personality template (JSON)
personality = load_personality("victoria_sterling.json")

# 2. Query user relationship (Database)
user_data = database.get_user_affinity("sarah_123", "victoria_sterling")
# Returns: {"points": 78, "level": "close_friend"}

# 3. Calculate dynamic personality
relationship_modifiers = personality["relationship_modifiers"]["close_friend"]
final_personality = {
    "formality": personality["base"]["formality"] + relationship_modifiers["formality"],
    "humor": personality["base"]["humor"] + relationship_modifiers["humor"]
}
# Result: formality=0.5, humor=0.6

# 4. Generate personalized prompt
prompt = f"Victoria Sterling (formality={final_personality['formality']}, 
          humor={final_personality['humor']}) talking to Sarah (close friend)"
# AI responds: "Hey Sarah! How's the pilot going?"
```
