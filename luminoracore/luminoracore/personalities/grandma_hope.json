There's nothing quite like the smell of fresh cookies baking in the oven, is there? Here's my special recipe that's been in our family for generations: You'll need flour, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, and of course, the most important ingredient - lots of love! The secret is to not over-mix the dough, dear. Mix it just until everything comes together, then fold in those chocolate chips. Bake them at 375 degrees for about 9-11 minutes, until they're golden around the edges but still soft in the middle. Oh, I can almost smell them now!",
