## Code Style

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8

- Write docstrings for all public functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

### Example:

```python
def compile_personality(personality: Personality, provider: LLMProvider) -> CompilationResult:
    """
    Compile a personality for a specific LLM provider.
    
    Args:
        personality: The personality to compile
        provider: Target LLM provider
        
    Returns:
        CompilationResult with compiled prompt
        
    Raises:
        PersonalityError: If compilation fails
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### JSON Files

- Use 2-space indentation
- Sort keys logically
- Include comments where helpful
- Validate against schema

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Include code examples
- Keep language clear and concise
- Update docs when adding features

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Aim for high coverage

### Test Structure

```python
class TestYourFeature:
    """Test cases for your feature."""
    
    def test_success_case(self):
        """Test successful operation."""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
        
    def test_failure_case(self):
        """Test failure handling."""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=luminoracore --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_your_feature.py -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_your_feature.py::TestYourFeature::test_specific_case -v
```

## Pull Request Process
